I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Statistics at the University of Washington.
I am fortunate to be advised by [Zaid Harchaoui](http://faculty.washington.edu/zaid/) and [Soumik Pal](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~soumik/).
Prior to that, I received my B.S. in mathematics and applied mathematics at Tsinghua University.  

I am broadly interested in safe and interpretable machine learning with applications in natural language processing.
<!-- In particular, I have been working on developing automatic change detection algorithms to monitor learning machines. -->
I am also excited about optimal transport and its applications in statistics and machine learning.  
<!-- I have been working on safe statistical machine learning by developing automatic change detection method for machine learning algorithms to monitor their behavior. -->
